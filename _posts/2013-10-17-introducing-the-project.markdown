I've been thinking for a while now that I wanted to play with a RaspberryPI, well really any hardware + software combination. There were a few things holding me back though, that is I wanted a project to apply this technology to and also i don't know the slightest thing about electronics or hardware interfaces.

Finally I've come up with a suitable idea with which to exert my efforts... An online fish tank monitoring system! Nevermind that I don't know nothing about fish, nevermind that these systems are available off the shelf, including hardware, for a couple of hundred dollars. Even if it ends up costing much more money, which surely it will and even if it takes years, which it may well do, that is the goal with which I've now purchased my RaspberryPi for.

Over the next few months I'll chronicle the progress and attempts and publish the code required to interface with my hardware and also the code used to host the dashboard including visualisations and alerting.

Inventory so far:
1 x Raspberry Pi Single Board Linux Computer - Model B = $59.50<br />
1 x Waterproof DS18B20 Digital temperature sensor = $9.56<br />
1x Double Side ProtoBoard 5cm * 7cm = $2.64

Running total = $73.83 AUD
