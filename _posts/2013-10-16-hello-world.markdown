What better way to try out Jekyll than a blog?

Over the next forever i'm going to embark on a project to create a live fish tank monitoring system using a RaspberryPi as the brains and a whole combination of various parts. I will endeavour to post various entries on how I went about different parts of the system.

Please bear with me as this is my first blog.

P.S. so far Jekyll has been dirt easy.
